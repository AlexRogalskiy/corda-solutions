Go To Market
============


Overview
--------

What to think about:

-  What are you selling?
-  Who are you selling it to?
-  How will you reach your target market?
-  Where will you promote your CordApp?

*This is an interactive process which will continue to evolve as you go
through the project lifecycle.*

Principles and good practices
-----------------------------

Principle / Practice 1
``````````````````````

**What are you selling?**

-  Use customer validation

This is about exploring issues, undersandting phenomena, and answering
questions by analyzing and making sense of unstructured data. For
previous projects like Marco Polo we used various Qualitative Research
methigs throughout the process to validate the Idea, Value Proposition,
Concept and the various Prototypes. For more info and templates:

-  Include ecosytem early on in the creation of the whole solution. In a
   distributed ledger product world we need to think of all the
   components that will play a role in delivering the whole solution -
   e.g.

   -  Hardware
   -  Software
   -  Billing system
   -  Service support
   -  Installation
   -  Cloud based UI
   -  Data analytics/Data providers
   -  Value added services/Oracles

-  *Tie this to the Partner strategy work*

-  What is the competitive elements of the Business Network? what is DLT
   providing to either an existing product improving the current
   offering or what new business models are being created?

   -  Pain Points => implications for customer (e.g. Bank) =>
      Implication for customers customers (e.g. Corporate) =>
      Opportunity fit

-  Commercial/Pricing - work from the start with the commercial and
   sales team to ensure different commercial arrangements and
   considerations are being made

   -  Transaction based licensing vs entity based licensing
   -  On-prem vs Cloud deployment
   -  Architectural considerations (e.g. how many nodes needs to run,
      how often they need to be active, what notary services does the
      solution need, representative nodes, 3rd management and hosting
      etc.)


Principle / Practice 2
``````````````````````

**Who are you selling it to?**

Who is your segment?

-  Define your customer market
-  If relevant define your customers customer - this is required to
   ensure the product fit and suc Any bugs or requests for new features
   that arise because of a support requests will be recorded within the
   ticketing and support system, and updates will be provided to the
   customer outlining which release the bug/new feature will be included
   in.


Principle / Practice N
