Business Case
=============
Corda is designed for the future of business. The applications and business networks supported by Corda will succeed because, and only if, the solutions deliver net-positive business outcomes for the users, providers, and necessary sponsors.  Therefore, the business case for each business network and CorDapp is an important pillar of a successful solution on Corda.

Overview
--------
A business case is a document that describes and quantifies the relationship between entities and operative parts of the business.  Every business is a system with inputs, outputs, and participants, all of which change over time.  The business case describes how that system works and shows the viewer with quantitative data.

The Business Case for Blockchain
--------------------------------

Blockchain technology may create opportunities to both reduce cost and increase revenue.  Marginal improvement is only visible by first quantifiying the costs and revenues in the market as-is.  This usually consists of a three-level business case: (1) the revenue and cost for end users, (2) the revenue and cost for service providers, and (3) the revenue and cost for platform or supporting technology providers.  This as-is picture should be calibrated and customized based on the user or provider's operational capabilities, partners, and context. 

The business case for blockchain should target points of centralization, redundant record-keeping, inter-party trust, or time buffers in a process.  These can be opportunities to cut cost by removing a middleman, reducing multiple data siloes, or reducing cycle and process times.  These could also be opportunities to increase revenue by creating new, efficient marketplaces, supplying trust as a service, or supplying revenue-generating activities with more ammunition through efficient secondary (or tertiary) markets. 

The Business Case for Corda
-----------------------------

With a positive business case for a blockchain technology solution, Corda can support and/or improve the business case given a few characteristics: 

   1. Privacy among users - If users require anonymity inside the business network, such that other participants cannot infer the identities or activities of other users
   2. Scalability of relationships - If users create and use relationships to many other users in varying permutations (A-B, B-C, A-C, A-B-C)
   3. Interoperability between applications - If users want to take assets or obligations from one business network and transact that asset on a second (or third) business network. 
   4. Regulation exposure - If users require the ability to expose parts of transactions to a regulator without exposing unnecessary data or drastically increasing operational risk


Principles and good practices
-----------------------------
A business case for a CorDapp and business network can be completed by the participants in a project, by the developers or funders of an application, by the business network operator, or by an outside consulting firm.

In many CorDapps and business networks, there will be two levels of business case: one for the end user of the application and another for the business network operator (or application developer, whoever is on the supply side).  For a CorDapp and business network to be successful, the business case must work for both sides.  The business case for R3 is not covered in this page.

This page describes the process and desired outcome for a business case, regardless of who delivers it.

The goal of each part of the business case is to break down the part of the system under analysis to a simple “P*Q” level.
In the quantity for all parts, use privately-supplied forecasts, public information, or assumptions, in that order of preference.
The X-axis of the business case is usually time.  If this is the case, pick a timeline that makes sense for the business and the information available.
The Y-axis is usually for the list of inputs, activities, and outputs.

Terminology and Formulas
-----------------------------------
Price = Price of the good/service to the client

Cost = Cost of the input/activity to the target

COGS = Cost of Goods Sold = (Cost of Inputs) + (Cost of Activities)

PTI = Pre-Tax Income

EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes

EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

Introduction
``````````````````````
Describe the business with participants, inputs, activities, and outputs.
Map the business case against the participants and activities.  Which participants’ business activities are you describing, and for what purpose? Create a new business case for each target.
List all baseline assumptions.

The Sections below are divided into operational activities (inputs, activities, and outputs) and capital activities (capital expenditure, long-term investment, appreciation/depreciation/amortization, etc). Operational activities have a marginal impact and can be started or stopped immediately – usually on a 30-day basis.  Capital activities usually have an impact over at least three months, or a significant share of the operational activities.

[Per Target]
-----------------------------------
Outputs
``````````````````````
This is the primary revenue part of the business case.
List the target’s outputs.  These are usually products or services.
List the options for revenue generation.  These include subscription fees, license fees, per-transaction fees, one-off fees, revenue share, etc.
As always, the goal is to simplify the business to a “P*Q” level.
Also note whether you are describing actual sales, revenue recognition, and any relevant accounting treatment.

Activities
``````````````````````
This is the first cost part of the business case.
List the targets’ activities and how the target pays for these, again on a “P*Q” basis.
Cost options for activities could be per [time], per input, per output, etc.

Inputs
``````````````````````
This is the main cost part of the business case.
List the target’s inputs and how the target pays for these. Include all inputs required for the activities and outputs.
Describe the cost for these inputs based on how the target pays for these

Gross Profit
``````````````````````
Gross profit is assessed on an operational basis.  GP = (Revenue) – (Cost) over the relevant period of time. GP% = (GP)/(Revenue)

Capital Activities
``````````````````````
Capital activities are dependent on the nature of the target’s long-term capital management.  As inputs, activities, and outputs describe the operations of the target, capital activities describe the assets.

Capital appreciation: This is rare outside of targets in finance or real estate.  Technology targets may list patents and IP here.  Otherwise this is for assets that appreciate in value.

Capital depreciation: Depreciating assets and amortization of investments (if not listed in capital investments).

Capital investments: One-time spend on asset acquisition or maintenance, either from the target’s internal capital accounts or from external investors.

Capital expenditures: Ongoing capital expenditures not related to specific inputs, activities or outputs.  This includes cost of sales, general expenditures, administrative fees, legal fees, marketing (sometimes called out separately), and any other ongoing expenditures.

This also includes cost of capital, if outside financing is raised, and interest on capital.

Net
``````
Total Capital Expenditure (or Appreciation) = (Capital Appreciation)-(Capital Depreciation)-(Capital Investments)-(Capital Expenditures)

Pre-Tax Income (PTI) = (GP)-(Total Capital Expenditure)

PTI% = (PTI)/(Revenue)

Executive Summary
``````````````````````

Pull the important lines from each target’s business case into a master executive summary. This should include the same parts described above, and should show the reader how each target impacts the overall business case.
