Product Design and Build
========================

Overview
--------

This section describes Product Build and Design for projects that include building a CorDapp.
 
 
Principles and good practices
-----------------------------
 
Principle 1 - Determine the Project Sponsors
````````````````````````````````````````````

Define the accountability structure among core & participating members – every project must have strong sponsorship:

The sponsor can be a member/groups of members or a partner/group of partners. The sponsor needs to be committed to making the project happen and to funding it. 
 
Examples:

* Member sponsor: Wells Fargo for Janus
* Partner sponsor: Calypso
* SI/ISV sponsor for Jasper III 
* Joint Venture (HQLAX)

Considerations for project accountability structure:

* Identify the Product Owner who will have accountability for product-specific decisions
* Identify the stakeholders and agree a steering committee
* Define Team Structure: roles & responsibilities based on background and subject matter expertise
* Consider legal and regulatory issues (link to Legal and Regulatory Stream)
* Consider questions of IP ownership structure (link to Legal & IP Stream)
* Build agreement on outcome: the vision for the product and whether prototype, pilot, or full production CorDapp

Principle 2 – Role of Product Owner
```````````````````````````````````

Assign the Product Owner & Document the Product Vision

The Product Owner (not necessarily the sponsor):

* Clearly states the business case and champions the vision and the outcome of the Product: what will the future state look like? (link to Business Case stream)
* Drives the product strategy: how to get there
* Ensures appropriate support, access to resources, communication and successful overall results
* Manages the roadmap, and the stakeholders
* Work with the team define feature requirements and groom and manage the backlog
* Estimates costs of build and adoption, and savings projections

The team needs to both acknowledge the leadership role of the Product Owner and expect strong direction on the product build.

Principle 3 – Customer Driven Design
````````````````````````````````````

Determine the Customer needs & document the Requirements

The product owner and team will:

* Identify pain points and possibilities for improved workflows and technical functions
* Re-engineer current business models to transition to a distributed model - map to the future state with a DLT infrastructure
* Create user stories, story boards, mock-ups as needed and include in backlog
* Define feature and functionality requirements
* Define technical (non-functional) requirements
* Document acceptance criteria and define ‘done’

Principle 4 Architecture Design
```````````````````````````````
Describe the Software & business architecture, including Business Network
Software Architecture

* Define MVP solution based on the prescribed DLT business model 
* Production considerations e.g. Technical Pilot setup, Business Networks, Privacy rules, Default protocols, Application Governance & System Integration
* Define Success Criteria
* Ensure that the design is capable of meeting evolving needs – bug fixing, upgrades, new features.

Business Architecture 

* Further validation of the business case
* Business Model and Go-To-Market Effort (link to Commercial Model Stream)
* Map Process flows - existing & new
* Map transaction lifecycle
* Define all events, actors
* Interview potential partners

Business Network:

* Governance and operational framework for the use case
* Initial legal/regulatory basis for the BN
* Define Notary, Doorman and Operator
* Align with evolving BNO Playbook

Principle 5 - Validate with Customers
`````````````````````````````````````

* Involvement of all participants in definition, design, and prototyping sprints and retrospectives
* Agreement and planning of testing and acceptance criteria
* Continuously inspect and adapt processes
* Product validation: SMEs external to project to review product feasibility, product design, and to participate in User Acceptance testing

Principle 6 - Platform Requirements
```````````````````````````````````
Communicate Corda platform requirements and CorDapp design to Product team 

* Assumption: the partner or member building the CorDapp has already been trained on Corda 
* Provide requirements, from the team building the CorDapp, to the Corda Platform team, e.g. firewall float
* Review Cordapp progress against Corda roadmap with Solution Architect to ensure alignment with Platform team

Principle 7 - Integration Architecture
``````````````````````````````````````

* To deploy DLT solutions into the financial institutions: 
* Provide enough data and information to allow Compliance to accept Corda
* Provide enough data and information about the CorDapp 
* Perform gap analysis on all processes, functions, roles, etc that are being re-created in DLT, and those that are not and map existing dependent business processes to DLT infrastructure & new product
* Estimate costs and savings implications
